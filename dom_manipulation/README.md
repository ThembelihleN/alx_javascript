DOM manipulation is a fundamental aspect of web development, especially in client-side scripting. It allows developers to create interactive and responsive web applications by manipulating the page's content and structure in real-time based on user interactions and data from external sources. Popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, and Angular provide additional tools and abstractions to simplify and streamline DOM manipulation tasks.
