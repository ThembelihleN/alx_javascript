Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on a user's web browser. These data files are used to store information about the user's interactions with the website.

Session Management: Cookies are commonly used to manage user sessions on websites. When you log in to a website, a cookie is often created to remember your session, so you don't have to re-enter your credentials on every page.

Personalization: Websites can use cookies to remember your preferences and settings. For example, a website might use a cookie to remember your language preference or the items you've added to your shopping cart.

Tracking: Cookies are often used for tracking user behavior. This can be for various purposes, including analytics (to understand how users navigate a site), advertising (to show you relevant ads based on your browsing history), and even security (to detect unusual or suspicious behavior).

Authentication: Cookies can be used to authenticate users. When you log in to a website, you may receive a session cookie that proves your identity as you navigate through different parts of the site.

Remembering Login Credentials: Some websites offer the option to remember your login credentials (username and password) using cookies, so you don't have to enter them every time you visit.

User Tracking and Profiling: In some cases, cookies are used to build user profiles based on their browsing history. This information can be used for targeted advertising or content recommendations.

Cookies are typically small text files that contain information such as a unique identifier, website domain, and expiration date. They can be either first-party cookies (associated with the website you're currently visiting) or third-party cookies (associated with a different domain, often used for advertising and tracking).
