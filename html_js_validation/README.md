JavaScript form validation is a technique used in web development to check and validate user input in HTML forms before the data is submitted to a server. It involves using JavaScript code to ensure that the data entered by the user meets specific criteria, constraints, or rules, such as required fields, correct data formats (e.g., email addresses), and acceptable values. The primary goals of JavaScript form validation are to enhance the user experience, improve data quality, and reduce the likelihood of server-side errors caused by invalid or malicious user input.
